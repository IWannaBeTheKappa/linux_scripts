### Screenshot tools
```area_screenshot.sh``` and ```full_screenshot.sh``` requires [``xclip``](https://github.com/astrand/xclip), [```imagemagick```](https://imagemagick.org/) and [```libnotify```](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/libnotify)  
Makes screenshot of screen (full\_screenshot.sh) or it's part (full\_screenshot.sh) to ```~/Pictures/Screenshot``` and copies it to clipboard

### Disk usage
```diskusage.sh``` don't requires any other utilities then standard \*nix has.  
It shows space usage of your root, trash folder, katogram cache and pacman/AUR caches.
